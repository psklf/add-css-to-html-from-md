# Add CSS to a HTML file
When you convert from markdown to a plain HTML file without style you may want to add some style to it.

I wrote this simple program to do such work: add the CSS file to the plain HTML file.
## Use

	Useage:
        -<source html file> -out <path> [-options]
    Options:
        -s:Use simple css
        -f:Use Github css

## CSS source
Get css from [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)
